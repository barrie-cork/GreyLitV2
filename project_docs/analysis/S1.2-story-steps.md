Requires:
- Consistent dependency versions
- Standard script definitions
- Proper workspace configuration
- Common development dependencies
- Consistent versioning

### Common Docker Configuration
Requires:
- Base Docker image definition
- Development environment setup
- Volume mapping configuration
- Network configuration
- Health check implementation

### Shared Build Scripts
Requires:
- Common build process
- Clean script functionality
- Development mode support
- Test execution capability
- Linting and formatting integration

### Development Environment Setup
Requires:
- Hot reload functionality
- Debug configuration
- Environment variable handling
- Local development tools
- Development server setup

### Consistent Service Structure Template
Requires:
- Standard directory layout
- Common file naming conventions
- Consistent import patterns
- Error handling structure
- Configuration management

### Health Check Endpoint Implementation
Requires:
- Standard health check route
- Service status reporting
- Dependency status checking
- Response time monitoring
- Error state handling

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1. Create Base TypeScript Configuration
Must Support:
- Shared tsconfig.json with common settings
- Path aliases for internal packages
- Declaration file generation
- Source map configuration

Manual Verification:
- Run tsc --noEmit to verify configuration
- Check that imports work across packages
- Verify type definitions are generated

Prerequisite: S1.1 completed

Developer Notes:
- Consider different environments (dev/prod)
- Focus on maintainable configuration
- Enable strict type checking

### Step 2. Establish Package Structure Template
Must Support:
- Standard directory layout
- Common file naming patterns
- Configuration file locations
- Test directory structure

Manual Verification:
- Create new service using template
- Verify all required files present
- Check naming conventions

Prerequisite: Step 1

Developer Notes:
- Keep structure simple and intuitive
- Include documentation templates
- Consider scalability needs

### Step 3. Configure Build and Development Scripts
Must Support:
- Build process for production
- Development mode with hot reload
- Clean script functionality
- Test execution

Manual Verification:
- Run build in production mode
- Test hot reload functionality
- Verify clean script works
- Run test suite

Prerequisite: Step 2

Developer Notes:
- Focus on developer experience
- Include error handling
- Consider build performance

### Step 4. Implement Docker Configuration
Must Support:
- Development environment setup
- Volume mapping for local development
- Network configuration
- Multi-stage builds

Manual Verification:
- Build Docker image successfully
- Run service in container
- Verify volume mounts work
- Check network connectivity

Prerequisite: Step 3

Developer Notes:
- Consider image size optimization
- Include security best practices
- Plan for different environments

### Step 5. Create Health Check Implementation
Must Support:
- Standard health check endpoint
- Dependency status checking
- Response time monitoring
- Error state reporting

Manual Verification:
- Call health check endpoint
- Verify all status checks work
- Test error condition handling
- Monitor response times

Prerequisite: Step 4

Developer Notes:
- Keep health checks lightweight
- Include meaningful status info
- Consider monitoring integration

### Step 6. Document Service Template
Must Support:
- Setup instructions
- Development guidelines
- Configuration options
- Troubleshooting guide

Manual Verification:
- Follow setup instructions from scratch
- Verify all steps are clear
- Test troubleshooting scenarios

Prerequisite: Step 5

Developer Notes:
- Include examples and explanations
- Consider different skill levels
- Keep documentation maintainable
