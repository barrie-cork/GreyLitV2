# Implementation Steps for Story S1.1: Project Structure and Development Environment

## Overview
These steps break down the implementation of the initial project structure and development environment setup.

## Steps

### Step 1. Initialize Monorepo Structure
Must Support:
- Root package.json with workspace configuration
- Standard directory structure for services
- Shared package directory
- Configuration files directory
Manual Verification:
- Verify workspace packages are recognized by yarn
- Confirm directory structure matches architecture
- Check shared package accessibility
Prerequisite: None
Developer Notes:
- Consider future service additions
- Plan for shared code organization
- Document directory structure decisions

### Step 2. Configure TypeScript Environment
Must Support:
- Strict type checking
- Path aliases for imports
- Separate configs for different environments
- Declaration file generation
Manual Verification:
- Test compilation with sample code
- Verify path aliases work
- Check declaration file output
Prerequisite: Step 1
Developer Notes:
- Consider module resolution strategy
- Plan for type sharing between services
- Document compiler options choices

### Step 3. Set Up Code Quality Tools
Must Support:
- ESLint with TypeScript rules
- Prettier code formatting
- Pre-commit hooks
- IDE integration
Manual Verification:
- Run linting on sample code
- Test automatic formatting
- Verify pre-commit hooks work
Prerequisite: Step 2
Developer Notes:
- Document rule customizations
- Consider team preferences
- Plan for rule maintenance

### Step 4. Create Development Environment
Must Support:
- Development container setup
- Hot reload capability
- Volume mounting
- Environment variable management
Manual Verification:
- Build development container
- Test file watching/reloading
- Verify environment variables
Prerequisite: Step 1
Developer Notes:
- Consider development workflow
- Plan for debugging setup
- Document environment setup

### Step 5. Establish Documentation Structure
Must Support:
- README with setup instructions
- Architecture documentation
- Development guidelines
- API documentation structure
Manual Verification:
- Follow README to set up project
- Verify documentation clarity
- Test documentation links
Prerequisite: Steps 1-4
Developer Notes:
- Plan documentation organization
- Consider documentation maintenance
- Include examples where helpful

### Step 6. Configure Project Standards
Must Support:
- Git ignore patterns
- Editor configurations
- Package manager settings
- Environment templates
Manual Verification:
- Test git ignore patterns
- Verify editor settings work
- Check environment template usage
Prerequisite: Steps 1-5
Developer Notes:
- Consider different development environments
- Plan for team onboarding
- Document configuration decisions
